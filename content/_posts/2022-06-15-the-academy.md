"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." (British philosopher A.N Whitehead)

Plato, a Greek philosopher who lived for a time at the Syracuse court. Founded the Academy (c.387<sub>B.C.</sub>) in Athens, the most influential and important learning instituion where he taught until his death in 347<sub>B.C.</sub>. A pupil and friend of Socrates, and taught one of the greatest philosopher, Aristotle.

Plato produced 35 dialogues and 13 letters including:

- Early (Socratic dialogues):
  - The Apology
  - Meno
  - Gorgias

- Middle dialogues:
  - The Republic
  - Phaedo
  - Symposium
  - Timaeus

- Later dialogues:
  - The Laws
  - Parmenides

In his magnum opus, <cite>The Republic</cite> Plato argues for the philosopher-king as best kind of ruler;
only a philosopher "understands the harmony of all parts of the universe with the Idea of the Good,"
and therefore, "is capable of ruling the just state."

> Virtue consists in the harmony of the human soul with the universe of Ideas, which assure order, intelligence, and pattern to a world in constant flux. Supreme among them is the Idea of the Good, analogous to the sun in the physical world.
