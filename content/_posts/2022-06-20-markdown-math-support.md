$$ AskClass + Equations = Pretty $$
<!--more-->

Math doesn't have to be hard.
Askclass now supports beautiful equation rendering for your nerdy needs.
Only last month, GitHub released the most requested feature for Markdown: Math support.
Today, the AskClass theme is proud to announce that we're supporting it.
Why? Because AskClass focuses on education and want to give our users the tools they need to
disseminate information and promote sharing of ideas!

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

Just look at Euler's equation above, isn't that pretty?
