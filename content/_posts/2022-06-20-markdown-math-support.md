AskClass News Theme supports Markdown math expressions in TeX & [LaTeX] using [MathJax].

$$ AskClass + Equations = ❤️ $$

Math doesn't have to be hard.
AskClass now supports beautiful equation rendering for your nerdy needs.
Only last month, GitHub released the most requested feature for Markdown: [Math support].
Today, the AskClass theme is proud to announce that we're supporting it.
Why? $$ \because $$ AskClass focuses on education and want to give our users the tools they need to
disseminate information and promote sharing of ideas!

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

Just look at Euler's equation above, isn't that pretty?
